1. Google API
	-In order to implement this we need to make use of the google maps api(not directions api)
	-To get the api, you first need to create an account with google, they require a credit card but you will not be charged anything yet.
	-In addition they give you $300 free trial period for a year.
	
2. The implementation
	-You will need your input fields (two of them, for source address and destination address)
	-A div for the map / if you want to show the map on your application
	
	After you implement and manage to display the map with correct coordinates.
	
3. Distance matrix service (You need to enable this API) in order to get the following
	- Distance between points
	- Time between two points
